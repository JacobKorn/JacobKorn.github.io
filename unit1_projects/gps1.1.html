                    <h3>Economics</h3>
                    <p> Pairs spend about 15% more time on programs than individuals. However, the resulting code has about 15% fewer defects. Along with code development time, other factors like field support costs and quality assurance also affect the expenses. IBM reported spending about “$250 million repairing and reinstalling fixes to 30,000 customer-reported problems”. Pair programming significantly reduces these expenses by reducing the defects in the programs.</p>

                    <h3>Design Quality</h3>
                    <p>A system with two programmers possesses greater potential for the generation of more diverse solutions to problems for three reasons: (1) the programmers bring different prior experiences to the task; (2) they may access information relevant to the task in different ways; (3) they stand in different relationships to the problem by virtue of their functional roles. In the attempt to share goals and plans, the programmers must overtly negotiate a shared course of action when a conflict arises between them. In doing so, they consider a larger number of ways of solving the problem than a single programmer alone might do. This significantly improves the design quality of the program as it reduces the chances of selecting a poor method.</p>
