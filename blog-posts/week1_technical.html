				<h2>EDA Week 1 Technical Blog - Website Comparison</h2>

				<h3><a href="www.harrys.com">Harry's</a></h3>

				<p>Harry's is a website that offers shaving products on a subscription model. The value propositions they are trying to communicate are a comfortable shave due to their high quality, cost savings due to their vertical supply chain and making your life easier by delivering their products on a time frame you choose.</p>

				<p>This website's main goal is to convey product and brand information and funnel visitors into purchasing actions. To do this they make the website very clear and remove everything except the messages they are trying to convey. When you land on the home page your eyes are drawn to the tube of Harry's shaving cream on the left hand side of the main image. The edges of this tube then direct you to the razor. These design elements are balanced on the right hand side by the text “Your Shave Should be a Breeze” with a button leading to a page where you can learn a little more and purchase the products in the picture. Through those simple elements the user is directed on a journey to the action they want you to take.</p>

				<p>For those who aren't so easily swayed or are encountering the brand and products for the first time, there is some more text and some images pocking just above the fold. These indicate to the user that there is more information further down and encourages them to scroll down.</p>

				<p>The pictures and text below the fold are very minimal, clean and clear. They show what comes in a set, the sets price and then encourages the user to click the “see all products” button. Below this section are more general brand discovery images that give links for the user to learn more about the company and what they are about. This builds rapport with the user.</p>

				<p>This website is very easy to navigate through and leaves you with a regal feeling of airs and grace due to its clean elegance. It creates a visual identity and follows up by offering ways for the user to acquire that identity.</p>

				<p>Despite their good job of creating desire I haven't purchased anything from their website. Old trusty is function well enough for now.</p>

				<h3><a href="www.vendhq.com">Vend</a></h3>

				<p>Vend is a cloud based point of sale platform and this page is the sales page. The value propositions they offer are to make your life easier by removing the complexity of legacy cash registers and POS systems. They also allow you to leverage your data through integrations with inventory management systems, accounting software, online sales portals, their api and more.</p>

				<p>Since the aim of Vend's website is also to sell a product / service they have similar goals to Harry's and have chosen a similar style in which to execute these goals.</p>
				
				<p>They create focus on the landing page by including an out of focus animated background image with sharp foreground features. The blurry background and movement makes it seem far  away and draws the eye to the sharp foreground images. For me, being more visual, my eye is drawn to the wireframe iPad running their software. The triangle in a circle in the center of this image indicates a video. After watching the video the next most prominent feature is the crisp title “POS software retailers love to use” and buttons leading to free trials and the video.</p>

				<p>Again the information poking above the fold technique is used to show the user there is more information to see.</p>

				<p>This website is also very crisp and clean, but it's language and style convey more of a feeling of simplicity, ease of use and freedom than Harry's.</p>

				<h3><a href="www.youtube.com">YoutTube</a></h3>

				<p>Youtube, as I'm sure you all know, is a website where users can publish content, watch content or do both. </p>

				<p>Youtube is very different to Harry's and Vend in that it is a web app. The goal of the website is to create a community and offer tools for video sharing... with adverts peppered through of course.</p>

				<p>The layout of the homepage reflects this with the main right hand column showing a stream of different content grouped under headings. This content is dynamic and changes based on what the users watches, what channels they subscribe to and the promotion budget of channel owners. On the left hand side is a menu to filter the content in the main view, and if you're logged in, browse the channels you have subscribed to. When logged in, other options become available to upload and manage you videos.</p>

				<p>The interface of Youtube tries to remain more neutral than the above websites. The brand is still recognisable, for example if you visit any Youtube page you can quickly identify the website as Youtube, but it is not overbearing or opinionated. This is a good thing, because the content it is displaying could be anything. If it had a busy, highly styled interface it would detract from the content it is displaying and potentially convey the opposite identity of what the content is trying to convey.</p>
