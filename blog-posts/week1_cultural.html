				<h2>EDA Week 1 Cultural Blog â€“ Chef's in the Kitchen</h2>

				<p>I must admit, even after reading all the articles on the net singing the praise of bootcamp style learning and what you could hope to achieve in nine weeks I still had my doubts. I've spent a lot of time learning very broadly myself. I feel I've progressed in orders of magnitude since I started, but still could not be relied on in any way to implement robust software solutions. How could a short nine weeks with these mystical wizards get me from where I am to employable?</p>

				<p>Well... After watching Shereef's intro to Dev Bootcamp it all makes sense. A core competency of a developer is quick assimilation and understanding of information. There are a number of ways to do this, some more effective than others, but ultimately its a skill that can be practiced. The interesting thing though is that speed of information assimilation not only depends on your academic intelligence and how diligently you can study; but the attitude you take to learning and how you interact with the people and communities around you. Soft skills and emotional intelligence are the missing part of self study. </p>

				<p>Judging from the video, Dev Bootcamp and Enspiral Dev Academy recognise this and endeavour to develop the cohorts emotional intelligence so they can be well adjusted, functioning members of a team where information, emotional state and intent flow freely. When you have a team of these sorts of people obstacles dissolve and they move forward. This is why I think EDA will be worthwhile. Its creating the perfect environment to soak in information and take advantage of synergies. Its also showing us what this environment looks like so we can gravitate towards or implement it post EDA.</p>

				<p>I'm looking forward to delving into this side of the course. Its a side I haven't thought much about in the past, but it makes a lot of sense.</p>
